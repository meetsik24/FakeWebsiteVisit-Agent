# Website Visitor Bot

This project is a Python script that simulates visits to a specified website. It uses random user agents and proxies to make the visits appear as if they are coming from different browsers and IP addresses.

## Features

- Simulates website visits using random user agents.
- Supports concurrent visits using multiple threads.
- Uses a list of proxies to simulate visits from different IP addresses.
- Logs visit attempts and results to both a file and the console.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `fake_useragent` library
- `concurrent.futures` library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/website-visitor-bot.git
    cd website-visitor-bot
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:

    ```sh
    pip install requests fake_useragent
    ```

## Usage

1. Edit the [webvisit.py](http://_vscodecontentref_/0) file to configure the URL, visit interval, maximum concurrent visits, and proxies.

2. Run the script:

    ```sh
    python webvisit.py
    ```

3. The script will log visit attempts and results to [web_visits.log](http://_vscodecontentref_/1) and the console.

## Example

Here is an example of how to configure and run the script:

```python
# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    proxies = [
        "http://proxy1.example.com:8080",
        "http://proxy2.example.com:8080",
        # Add more proxies as needed
    ]
    visitor = WebsiteVisitor(
        url="https://www.meetpay.africa",
        visit_interval=(10, 15),  # Random interval between 10 and 15 seconds
        max_concurrent=3,  # Maximum concurrent visits
        proxies=proxies
    )
    
    # Run the visitor with a limit of 5 visits
    total_visits, total_errors = visitor.run_visitor(max_visits=5)
    print(f"Completed {total_visits} visits with {total_errors} errors.")
